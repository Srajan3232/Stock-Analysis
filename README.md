# Stock-Analysis
The Stock Analysis Python project that empowers investors and analysts to extract valuable insights from stock market data. The project encompasses a range of analytical techniques to understand stock behavior over time.

Starting with trend analysis, the project tracks and analyzes the change in stock prices over time. By visualizing price trends and identifying patterns, it provides insights into historical performance and potential future directions.

The integration of moving average analysis enables the identification of long-term trends and smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This technique aids in recognizing trends that might not be evident in raw data.

Employing resampling analysis, the project offers a comprehensive overview of closing prices at different time intervals. This technique helps identify short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, enabling strategic decision-making.
